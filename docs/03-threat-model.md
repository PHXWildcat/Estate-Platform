# Estate Planning Platform — Threat Model

**Version:** 1.0 · Methodology: STRIDE per trust boundary + attacker-goal analysis, mapped to NIST 800-53 control families. This document is a living artifact; every new feature PR that crosses a trust boundary requires a threat-model delta.

---

## 1. What makes this platform's threat profile unusual

Most fintech threat models optimize for "attacker steals money today." This platform has three additional properties that reshape the model:

1. **It is a treasure map.** A single account enumerates every asset a family owns, where it is, what it's worth, who inherits it, and — via the vault — the credentials to reach it. Compromise value per account is far higher than a bank login.
2. **Death is a state transition with privileges attached.** The settlement workflow deliberately transfers access to third parties upon death. Any workflow that grants access on death can be attacked by *faking death* or by *being an insider to a real death* (the grieving-family window is a social-engineering goldmine).
3. **Authorized users are potential adversaries.** Trustees, executors, caregivers, and family members hold legitimate grants and also commit a large share of real-world elder financial abuse. The threat model must treat *granted* access as a monitored surface, not a solved problem.

## 2. Adversaries

| Adversary | Capability | Primary goals |
|---|---|---|
| Nation-state / APT | 0-days, supply chain, long dwell | Bulk PII, HNW-individual targeting, persistence |
| Organized crime | Credential stuffing, SIM swap, phishing kits, ransomware | Vault contents, asset intel for fraud, extortion |
| Malicious insider (platform) | Legitimate infra/DB access | Bulk decryption, audit tampering, targeted snooping |
| Malicious insider (estate) | Legitimate role grants | Over-broad access, premature settlement, distribution fraud |
| Opportunist / abusive family member | Owner's devices, shared knowledge, coercion | Account takeover of elderly users, beneficiary manipulation |
| Curious/negligent third-party pro | Attorney/CPA portal access | Data overexposure, credential mishandling |
| Automated/AI-driven attacker | Scaled spearphishing, voice cloning of "the deceased's lawyer" | Settlement-phase social engineering |

## 3. Trust boundaries

TB1: Internet → Edge (CloudFront/WAF/API GW) · TB2: Edge → Services (authn/z) · TB3: Service ↔ Service (mesh) · TB4: Services → Data stores · TB5: Platform → Third parties (Plaid, LLM providers, death-data providers, notification carriers) · TB6: Client device (Zone A crypto happens here) · TB7: Human operators → Production · TB8: Role-holders → Owner's estate data.

## 4. STRIDE highlights per boundary (top findings, not exhaustive)

**TB1/TB2 — Edge & AuthN**
- *Spoofing:* Credential stuffing and SIM-swap-based recovery abuse. → Passkey-first, SMS never sufficient alone, breach-corpus password checks, per-IP+per-account rate limits, device binding.
- *DoS:* Shield Advanced + autoscaling + per-tenant load shedding; settlement endpoints get separate quotas so an attack can't mask fraud attempts in noise.
- *Info disclosure:* GraphQL introspection off in prod; persisted queries only; error responses genericized.

**TB4 — Data stores**
- *Tampering:* Audit chain hash-anchored to WORM storage; DB roles cannot UPDATE/DELETE event tables; nightly chain verification with paging on gap.
- *Info disclosure:* Bulk-decryption detection — per-principal decrypt-rate baselines with hard circuit breakers (a service that normally decrypts 50 fields/min gets its KMS grant suspended at 50×, paging security). This is the single most important insider control: the KMS grant, not the database, is the chokepoint.
- *Elevation:* IRSA-scoped pod identities; no shared DB users; RLS as a second net under application authz.

**TB5 — Third parties**
- *Plaid token theft:* Access tokens decryptable only inside the sync worker's isolated namespace; tokens are per-item revocable; webhook signatures verified; anomalous sync patterns alert.
- *LLM data leakage:* Privacy proxy tokenizes names/SSNs/account numbers before provider calls; zero-retention contracts; per-feature consent; prompt-injection defense for any AI feature that reads user-uploaded documents (uploaded doc content is untrusted input — the assistant must never treat document text as instructions, and tool scopes for the assistant are read-only).
- *Death-data providers:* Treated as *signals*, never triggers. See §5.1.
- *Supply chain:* Pinned digests, SBOM + SLSA provenance, cosign verification at admission, dependency review gates, vendored critical libs, no postinstall scripts in CI.

**TB6 — Client**
- *Vault key theft via malware/XSS:* Strict CSP, Trusted Types, no third-party scripts on vault surfaces, WebCrypto non-extractable keys where platform allows, memory zeroization best-effort, clipboard auto-clear, re-auth on vault open.
- *Coercion/shoulder-surfing of elderly users:* Optional "trusted-contact review" mode where high-risk changes (new beneficiary + address change + export within 24h) trigger a notification hold.

**TB7 — Operators**
- No standing prod access; JIT elevation with peer approval and session recording; all operator reads of user data are themselves audit events surfaced to the user ("Anthropic-style" transparency: users can see that support accessed X on date Y); separation of duties between deploy, data, and key administration.

## 5. Platform-specific attack scenarios (the ones generic checklists miss)

### 5.1 Fraudulent death trigger ("kill them on paper")
**Attack:** Adversary (often a would-be heir or an account-takeover attacker who wants executor-level access) reports the owner dead with a forged certificate or exploits a false-positive from a death-data provider.
**Controls:** (1) No automated trigger from any single source — provider matches only open a *case*. (2) Mandatory human review of certified evidence. (3) Waiting period (default 5 days, configurable up) during which the platform aggressively attempts owner contact through every channel including hardware-key challenge; any owner sign-in with step-up MFA instantly voids the case and flags the reporter. (4) Account enters `deceased_pending` — reads freeze for role-holders; nothing unlocks early. (5) Executor access post-verification is *staged*: inventory first, vault emergency-access last, each stage separately approved. (6) The reporter's identity is verified and recorded; fraudulent reports are preserved for law enforcement.

### 5.2 Emergency-access abuse
**Attack:** A designated emergency contact invokes vault access while the owner is alive but unaware (hospitalized, traveling, cognitively declining).
**Controls:** Waiting period ≥ 24h (owner-configurable), multi-channel owner notification with one-tap deny, optional M-of-N Shamir requirement so no single contact can unlock alone, full audit visible to owner afterward, and scope limits (contacts can be granted vault subsets, not all-or-nothing).

### 5.3 Insider bulk decryption
**Attack:** Platform engineer or compromised service identity attempts mass read of SSNs/documents.
**Controls:** Per-user DEKs mean bulk access requires bulk KMS operations — rate-limited, anomaly-detected, circuit-broken (§4/TB4); CloudHSM roots mean even AWS-level compromise can't silently exfiltrate key material; canary records (fake users with tripwire fields) page on any access.

### 5.4 Grief-window social engineering
**Attack:** After a real death, attackers phish executors/beneficiaries ("probate portal fee required"), possibly with AI voice cloning of the family attorney.
**Controls:** All settlement communication happens in-app only; emails/SMS are content-free pointers by design, and onboarding for role-holders drills this ("we will never link you to a payment page"); executor dashboard shows verified contact cards for the estate's attorney/CPA; distribution approvals are dual-control with step-up MFA.

### 5.5 Beneficiary-conflict information abuse
**Attack:** A beneficiary with read access enumerates other beneficiaries' shares to contest or coerce.
**Controls:** ABAC default — beneficiaries see only assets naming them and only their own designation, unless the owner explicitly opens visibility; access-pattern anomalies (rapid enumeration) alert the owner.

### 5.6 Ransomware / destructive attack
**Attack:** Encrypt-and-extort against databases and object storage.
**Controls:** Immutable, cross-account, Vault-Locked backups the prod account cannot delete; monthly automated restore verification; event-sourced domains can rebuild projections; ransomware-specific runbook with decision tree and pre-negotiated IR retainer; audit chain proves data integrity post-recovery.

## 6a. Threat-model delta — M6 vault, Zone A (2026-07-27)

This document requires a delta for every feature PR that crosses a trust
boundary. M6 activates **TB6 (client device)** in earnest: until now no code
held keys the server could not derive, and risk #4 (vault client-side
compromise, Critical) described something that did not exist yet.

**Controls now shipped.**
- Keys derive from the vault password AND a 128-bit device-only Secret Key
  (2SKD), so the server-held verifier and wrapped master key are useless to an
  attacker who has the database and a correct password guess. This is the
  control that makes §5.3 (insider bulk decryption) structurally inapplicable to
  Zone A: there is no bulk decryption path, because there is no decryption path.
- The vault password never transits (SRP-6a). Every unlock failure emits
  `vault.open.failed`, which is what makes §4/TB4-style burst detection possible
  for vault access specifically.
- Master and item keys are unwrapped as **non-extractable `CryptoKey`s**, the
  TB6 "non-extractable keys where the platform allows" control — an injected
  script in the vault origin can use them but not read them out.
- `@estate/vault-crypto` has zero runtime dependencies, enforced by lint and by
  a source-scanning test. This is the TB6 supply-chain control: the code holding
  the only keys that open a vault has no transitive tree to compromise.
- The client pins the KDF and SRP parameters the server serves it, so a
  malicious server cannot downgrade the group or the iteration count.
- Step-up MFA gates vault open and all key-material changes, per §5 of the
  architecture doc.

**Residuals accepted, and why.**
- *JS `bigint` is not constant-time.* True of every JavaScript SRP; bounded by
  network jitter, and no code path branches early on a secret comparison.
- *Full-history rollback.* A server that serves an old blob AND claims its old
  version is detectable only by client-side last-seen state. Same class as every
  hosted zero-knowledge store. Per-version AAD binding stops the easier attack:
  replaying a blob at a *different* version fails to decrypt.
- *Reset is token-gated.* A forgotten password cannot be proven, so the reset
  route is the one place step-up-fresh stolen tokens can destroy — never read —
  a vault. Compensating: distinct audit action, step-up freshness, and owner
  notification when the notification port lands.
- *No rate limiting on failed SRP proofs yet.* Tracked with identity's login
  rate limiting; handshakes burn on attempt in the meantime.

**§5.2 emergency-access controls, now shipped (M6 PR2).**
- *Waiting period ≥24h, owner-configurable:* enforced by the platform half of a
  two-level split (`RK = platform_part XOR contacts_part`). Colluding grantees
  hold only the contacts half, which is information-theoretically useless alone,
  so the delay is a cryptographic constraint rather than an honour system.
- *Multi-channel owner notification with one-tap deny:* the notification port
  ships with a stub, and the emergency-access routes **refuse in production**
  while only the stub is wired — a waiting period nobody can be told about is
  not a control. Denial is deliberately the one owner action with no step-up
  requirement, because it must be one tap from a notification.
- *Optional M-of-N:* implemented over GF(2^8), threshold 1 by default.
- *Full audit visible to the owner afterward:* every transition is recorded,
  including refused requests, so a grantee who tried repeatedly is visible.
- *Denial is sticky*, with no time-based cooldown — a cooldown would tell a
  patient grantee how long to wait, and outlasting the owner is the attack.
- *Key substitution* (not in §5.2's list, but the same threat class): shares are
  sealed to a public key the owner confirms out of band by fingerprint, and the
  key each share was sealed to is recorded so a later change is detectable.

**Residual accepted here:** the platform half lives on the server, so a server
that releases it early defeats the waiting period. Inherent to docs/01's design
— a delay enforced by a party is only as good as that party. The split still
guarantees that a database dump alone is insufficient, and that no contact can
act alone.

**Not yet shipped, and therefore not yet mitigated.**
- §5.2's *scope limits* (granting a contact a vault subset) remain deferred;
  per-item keys are in place so it is a later grant feature, not a
  re-architecture.
- §5.1 control 5 — settlement's staged access, with vault emergency access last
  and separately approved — is an **M7 integration point**. The release path
  must consult settlement state once settlement exists.
- The isolated vault origin, CSP, and Trusted Types are frontend controls; no
  vault UI ships in M6, so they land with that surface.

## 6b. Threat-model delta — M7 settlement PR1 (2026-07-27)

M7 activates **TB8 (role-holders → owner's estate data)** in earnest: it is the
first flow where the acting principal is routinely NOT the resource owner, and
the first that deliberately changes another user's account state. §5.1 is the
control specification; this delta records how each control landed.

**Controls now shipped (PR1: intake → review → waiting period → verified).**
- *No automated trigger from any single source (control 1).* Intake only OPENS
  a case. Reporters must already be named by the decedent's contact repository
  (`contacts.linked_user_id`) — no lookup by email or arbitrary id exists, so
  intake cannot enumerate accounts. Death-data provider matches are
  operator-filed signals (`data_provider`), never triggers. One open case per
  decedent (partial unique index).
- *Mandatory human review (control 2).* Operators are ordinary platform users
  on a CLI-managed allowlist (`settlement_operators`; deliberately NO runtime
  grant API — a stolen operator session cannot mint operators). Review
  decisions are step-up-gated; reviewer ≠ reporter is a DDL CHECK plus a row
  check; "no privileged status without recorded review" is a DDL CHECK. The
  reviewing operator can read death-certificate evidence through a dedicated
  documents route whose authority is settlement's answer, cross-checked
  against the document's REAL owner — a reporter registering someone else's
  document id as evidence gets an operator a uniform 404, not a decryption.
- *Waiting period with aggressive owner contact (control 3).* Default 5 days,
  owner-configurable UP to 60 (floor in DDL + schema + service; changes
  refused while a case is open — a pending case's parameters are frozen).
  Escalating contact attempts on a 12h multi-channel schedule, recorded
  append-only. The in-process driver that performs them holds NO transition
  power: timer expiry only makes a case ELIGIBLE; an operator (again never the
  reporter) explicitly confirms, and the confirmation re-checks owner liveness
  against identity's append-only step-up ledger — a step-up newer than the
  case voids it on the spot, restores the account, and flags the reporter.
  That check is enforced TWICE, deliberately: settlement reads liveness before
  asking for the terminal transition, and identity restates the predicate in
  the same single statement as the status write (a `NOT EXISTS` over
  `auth_events` in the CAS `UPDATE`, same cluster, no network hop). Without
  the second one, a step-up landing between settlement's read and its commit
  would be invisible, and — since there is no un-verify ceremony — would
  entomb a living owner in `settlement` irreversibly. The interlock turns that
  race into a refusal (`409 owner_alive`) that voids the case instead.
  The owner's own kill switch is a step-up-gated void route (the step-up IS
  the liveness proof; a bare stolen bearer cannot void).
- *Account enters deceased_pending (control 4).* Cross-service, identity-
  enforced: a closed transition table (active↔deceased_pending→settlement)
  behind a dedicated service credential; identity applies its own invariants
  regardless of what settlement asks. The lock call happens INSIDE the case
  transaction — an unconfirmable lock rolls the transition back. During
  deceased_pending the OWNER's login and sessions stay alive (the rescue
  path) while profile's role-holder contact grants freeze. At verified the
  status becomes `settlement`, every session is revoked, live-token lookups
  fail via a status allowlist in the session SQL, and re-login gets the
  generic 401 with a distinct recorded reason (`account_settled` — decedent-
  credential replay is a detection signal). Post-verified rescue is
  deliberately not self-serve.
- *Reporter identity preserved (control 6).* `reported_by` is a verified
  platform user; rejected and voided cases are terminal rows that are never
  deletable (cases have no soft delete BY DESIGN), with `resolution`
  distinguishing operator rejection from owner void; every audit event on the
  flow preserves the reporter id.

**New trust machinery, flagged.** A static shared service credential
(`ServiceCredentialGuard`, constant-time compare, fail-closed when unwired;
required ≥32 chars in production) authenticates settlement on identity's
internal settlement-lock routes — the one flow with no user bearer token to
forward by construction. Interim until the mesh (mTLS/SPIFFE) provides
verifiable peer identity; the guard is the seam.

**Deliberate deviations.** Temporal is deferred behind a powerless in-process
driver (approved: there is no deployment for its durability to protect; the
DB state machine docs/02 §7 mandates is authoritative either way). Intake and
review-approve REFUSE in production while only the stub notifier is wired
(503, the M6 emergency-access precedent) — a waiting period nobody can be
told about is not a control.

**Control 5 — staged executor access — now shipped (PR2).**
- *Staged, ordered, separately approved.* `inventory → documents → vault`, and
  the order IS the control: an executor may request only the next rung, each
  requires an operator approval, and Zone A is therefore structurally the
  furthest grant from a fresh death report. A requested stage grants nothing.
- *Two people per stage.* The executor requests, an operator approves, and a
  DDL CHECK forbids them being the same person. Executor designation
  (`role_assignments`, the dormant `on_death_verified` half that settlement is
  the first consumer of) grants nothing on its own.
- *§6a closed.* The vault's emergency-access `request` AND `release` now
  consult settlement — twice, once before the waiting clock starts and again
  inside the release transaction after the row lock, because the period is
  days long and an estate can enter settlement in between. A non-terminal case
  without an approved `vault` stage BLOCKS; so does an unreachable settlement,
  since the client fails closed on every path. That direction is deliberate:
  blocking delays a legitimate recovery (the escrow is unspent and releases
  once the stage lands), while allowing hands a fraudulent "heir" the platform
  half of the recovery key inside the very window §5.1 exists to protect.
  Refusals are audited as `vault.emergency.release_blocked` with the case id.
  The gate is authenticated by the SERVICE credential, not the grantee's
  bearer — the question is about the owner's estate, not the caller's rights.
- *Distributions under dual control* (docs/02 §7): the recorder is stamped from
  the verified session at insert, the approver must differ, and a row-local
  CHECK enforces it immediately rather than a trigger (both parties are columns
  of the same row, so a CHECK is stricter — undeferrable and unbypassable).
  Amounts are envelope ciphertext under settlement's own `settlement/kek`, so
  profile's KMS grant cannot read them even sharing the cluster; the plaintext
  never enters a column, a log, or an audit payload.
- *Estate reads are the data owner's decision.* Assets exposes a separate
  executor route that forwards the caller's bearer to settlement and refuses on
  anything short of an explicit allow; settlement itself holds no data-read
  power, so compromising it mis-answers questions rather than exfiltrating an
  estate. Each such read is audited as `asset.estate.viewed` with the decedent
  as `onBehalfOf`.
- *Legal hold* (docs/00 compliance) is now settable — by settlement only,
  through a service-credential internal route, closing the M4 gap where the
  hold was enforced but had no writer.

**Residual added by PR2.** A settlement operator can approve every stage of a
case they did not report, so an insider operator plus a colluding "executor"
designation is a two-party path to an estate. Bounded by: the executor
designation must already exist in the decedent's own contact records (made
before the death), the reporter≠reviewer and requester≠approver rules, the
waiting period and owner-void that precede any of it, and a fully audited
trail. Reducing it further needs M-of-N operator approval, which belongs to
the TB7 operator-platform milestone alongside JIT elevation.

**Residuals accepted.** The liveness interlock narrows the lockout race to a
single statement but cannot erase it: a step-up committing inside that
statement's window is still missed. The blast radius is bounded — after the
transition, sessions are revoked and the status allowlist blocks every session
lookup, so the step-up buys nothing and the attempt is preserved in
`auth_events` for after-the-fact review — and closing it completely would
require the step-up path to take the users row lock, which is the right shape
for the operator-platform milestone rather than a settlement-side fix. A
settlement operator is a high-value target; the
interim allowlist has no JIT elevation or peer approval (TB7 milestone), and
one operator both approves and confirms a case (two actions, one human) —
bounded by reviewer≠reporter, the liveness re-check, the owner's void, and
the append-only audit trail; PR2's stage approvals add multi-party depth.
Rate limiting on intake shares identity's rate-limit follow-up (per-reporter
noise is bounded by the linked-contact gate and one-open-case index).

**Service-credential scoping (added by the M7 security review, 2026-07-28).**
The internal service credentials introduced for the account lock and the §6a
gate are the one M7 mechanism that can bypass §5.1's control chain outright, so
they carry their own rule: **one secret per callee, per direction.** Each
variable is named for the service whose internal routes it OPENS
(`IDENTITY_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, `SETTLEMENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN`,
`DOCUMENTS_INTERNAL_TOKEN`), never for the caller that presents it, and no
value ever authenticates in both directions.

The review found the original design violating this: settlement used one config
field as both its inbound-expected and its outbound-presented value, which
transitively forced identity, settlement, vault and documents onto a single
shared secret. Anyone holding vault's copy — the most exposed service in the
product, and by Zone A design the one that should hold the least authority —
could call `PUT /internal/v1/settlement-lock/{victim}` twice and irreversibly
move a living user to `settlement` status with no case, no operator, no waiting
period and no owner-void window. That is §5.1's Critical outcome reached by
skipping every control above, and it is the sharpest illustration of why the
credential is scoped rather than shared: a static bearer secret confers exactly
the routes it opens, so the blast radius IS the naming discipline.
Settlement's config refuses to boot in production when its two credentials are
equal, because splitting the field does not stop an operator pasting one value
into both slots. Rotation remains a synchronized restart of two services; the
mesh mTLS/SPIFFE follow-up removes the static secret rather than improving it.
