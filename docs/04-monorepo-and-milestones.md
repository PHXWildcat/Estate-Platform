# Estate Planning Platform — Monorepo Structure & Milestone Plan

**Version:** 1.0 · Approved 2026-07-20. Companion to `00`–`03`. This records the agreed
repository layout, boundary rules, and the milestone sequence for implementation.

## Tooling

pnpm workspaces + Turborepo. Version policy via pnpm **catalogs** (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`);
dependency build scripts blocked by default (`onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlist, kept
near-empty). Strict TypeScript everywhere via `packages/config/tsconfig.base.json`.
Backend targets CommonJS; internal packages are consumed through their built `dist`
(Turborepo orders `^build`) — no TS path aliases.

## Layout

```
apps/
  web/                  Next.js (dashboard, auth, vault UI)
  bff/                  GraphQL BFF — persisted queries, depth/complexity limits
  services/             one NestJS app per bounded context (docs/01 §2)
    identity/ profile/ assets/ documents/ vault/ settlement/
    ai-assistant/ referral/ notifications/ search-indexer/ audit/
packages/
  config/               tsconfig base, jest preset
  contracts/            Kafka event schemas (zod), internal API types, GraphQL manifest
  crypto/               SERVER-side envelope encryption (KMS-wrapped DEKs), blind indexes
  vault-crypto/         CLIENT-side Zone A crypto (2SKD, SRP) — isolated, minimal deps
  db/                   migration runner + generators for docs/02 conventions
  audit-emitter/        typed audit producer — IDs/enums only, enforced at runtime
  auth-guard/           session verification, step-up freshness, Cedar PEP middleware
  kafka/                topic registry, producer/consumer wrappers, Zone B payload crypto
  ui/                   design system (Tailwind, WCAG AA+, dark mode)
  testing/              testcontainers harnesses, fixtures
infra/
  terraform/{modules,envs}/   helm/   argocd/
tools/                  codegen, release scripts
docs/                   00–04 + docs/adr/ going forward
```

## Boundary rules (enforced, not aspirational)

1. **Each service owns its migrations** (`apps/services/<svc>/migrations/`). No shared
   migrations, no cross-cluster joins; consistency via events (docs/02 §8).
2. **Local dev runs six separate Postgres containers** (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) so no
   code ever assumes cluster co-location. Ports 5433–5438.
3. **`vault-crypto` ≠ `crypto`.** Zone A client-side code is its own package with a
   near-zero dependency tree (TB6 audit surface). Server-side `crypto` (KMS) must never
   be importable from `apps/web` — lint-enforced.
4. **Services never import each other** — only `packages/*`. `web` may import `ui`,
   `contracts`, `vault-crypto` only.
5. **CI security gates are merge-blocking from commit one:** gitleaks, CodeQL,
   dependency review; tfsec/OPA once Terraform lands.

## Milestones

### M1 — Secure walking skeleton (shipped 2026-07-21; open items below)
Foundation packages (`config`, `contracts`, `crypto`, `db`, `audit-emitter`,
`auth-guard`) + **identity service** (auth-cluster DDL per docs/02 §1, registration with
encrypted email + blind index, Argon2id, passkeys, TOTP, sessions with refresh rotation,
step-up ≤5 min window, Cedar deny-by-default PEP) + **audit service** (Kafka consumer,
append-only hash-chained `audit_events`, chain verification) + thin BFF and Next.js auth
flows. **Acceptance:** E2E register → login → step-up → gated action → audit event
verified in chain; automated schema-convention checker passes (soft delete, `_versions`
tables, REVOKEs); no plaintext PII in logs under integration inspection; coverage gates
95/90.

**M1 status.** Shipped: foundation packages; identity service (WebAuthn schema in
place, endpoints deferred); audit service; GraphQL BFF (persisted operations enforced
in production, httpOnly-cookie sessions, CSRF header, masked errors); Next.js auth
flows (register/login/TOTP/step-up, design tokens, dark mode, AA+); walking-skeleton
E2E (`apps/e2e`, PG-gated) proving identity's exact produced bytes ingest into a
verified audit hash chain; schema-convention checker (`@estate/db checkConventions`)
run against both migrated schemas; CI guard failing the build if integration suites
would silently skip. **Open items rolling into M2:** Cedar PDP integration (guards
are deny-by-default but policy engine not wired), WebAuthn endpoints, Kafka
broker-hop E2E (needs Redpanda locally/in CI — current E2E bridges producer bytes to
the ingestor in-process), AWS KMS adapter (LocalKmsProvider is dev-only), coverage
thresholds (CI now prints coverage; gate at 95/90 once CI-measured numbers exist),
monthly audit partitions + S3 Object Lock anchoring, identity logout/revocation
endpoint, BFF depth/complexity limits.

**M1 security review (2026-07-21).** A focused review of the shipped code found no
exploitable vulnerability in the committed (dev) configuration. One production-conditions
finding is tracked here for M2:
- *Registration account-enumeration timing channel (Medium).* `register()` equalizes
  response body/status and the Argon2 cost, but the new-email path awaits extra KMS + DB
  + Kafka work; under production wiring an existing email returns measurably faster,
  giving a membership oracle. Not exploitable today (dev uses in-process KMS/audit
  doubles). Fix direction: an email-verification flow returning a fixed-shape, fixed-time
  response regardless of address existence. Decoy work (risks orphaned DEKs) and
  fire-and-forget publishing (breaks the audit-before-completion invariant) are both
  rejected as fixes. Docstring on `auth.service.ts register()` no longer overclaims.
Verified clean in review: AEAD/AAD binding, blind-index domain separation, opaque-token
handling, session/step-up guards, refresh rotation-reuse, all parameterized SQL and the
identifier-validating generators, the migrator, Kafka-message deserialization + PII
firewall, and the BFF cookie/CSRF/persisted-operations model.

### M2 — Security hardening + profile/contacts (in progress)
Shipped so far on `claude/m2-security-hardening`: `@estate/kms-aws` (production
AWS KMS provider, wired into identity — prod uses AWS KMS, dev LocalKmsProvider,
fail-fast); `@estate/authz` (Cedar PDP, deny-by-default, owner/beneficiary
policies); WebAuthn passkey register/authenticate in identity (passkey as a
step-up factor) with its audit actions added to `@estate/contracts` and emitted
to Kafka; per-package **coverage gates** (jest thresholds set just below current
coverage, ratcheting toward 95/90 — CI runs `pnpm test --coverage`). Profile &
contacts service (core cluster) — **shipped**: field-encrypted profiles/family/
contacts/role assignments/permission grants, the first Cedar PEP (`ProfileAuthz`,
deny-by-default) proving the §5.5 beneficiary ABAC (a grant-holder reads only the
named resource), caller identity via gateway-injected `x-estate-user-id`.

**M2 follow-ups noted while building:**
- **Cross-request DEK race (crypto package).** `getOrCreateDek` is
  find-then-insert; two concurrent first-writes for the same brand-new user can
  each mint a DEK. The intra-request parallel race is fixed (pre-materialize the
  DEK before parallel field encryption, in identity + profile), but the
  cross-request case wants a DB guard — a partial unique index on
  `deks(user_id) WHERE destroyed_at IS NULL` plus an ON CONFLICT upsert in the
  repository. Affects every service using per-user DEKs.
- Core-cluster **domain-event** contracts/topic (profile emits audit events only
  for now); real cross-service session verification to replace the trusted
  `x-estate-user-id` header; asset-scoped beneficiary ABAC when the asset service
  lands; a Cedar schema for `validateRequest`.

**M2 security review (2026-07-21).** Structured review (discovery + adversarial
filter) of the M2 diff: no authz bypass, injection, crypto, or data-exposure vuln
above the bar; the Cedar PEP, per-user field encryption, KMS context-binding, and
WebAuthn origin/challenge/clone controls all verified fail-closed. One confirmed
finding, **fixed in-branch**:
- *WebAuthn step-up accepted user-presence, not user-verification (Medium).* The
  passkey ceremony that elevates a session to step-up used `userVerification:
  'preferred'` and omitted `requireUserVerification` at verify, so a presence-only
  tap could satisfy step-up — the same gate as a TOTP code (docs/01 §5). In-scope
  for the docs/03 §2 device-access adversary. Fixed: `userVerification: 'required'`
  in both option generators, `requireUserVerification: true` at both verify calls,
  and the step-up elevation now gated on `authenticationInfo.userVerified`.

### M3 — Asset ledger (first half shipped 2026-07-21; Plaid isolate is the second half)
Scope agreed: manual-asset ledger first (backend only), Plaid isolating service as a
separate second PR — `plaid_items`/`accounts` DDL deliberately deferred with it so no
dormant schema gets frozen by migration drift detection.

**Shipped:** `apps/services/assets` (financial cluster) — event-sourced write model
per docs/02 §3: `asset_events` (append-only, encrypted payloads AAD-bound to
`user_id`+`event_id`) → `assets_view` + `asset_beneficiaries` projected in the SAME
transaction through a pure reducer (`projection.ts`); projection rebuild CLI
(`rebuild-cli.js`, report/`--repair`) as the docs/02 §8 DR integrity check, decrypting
as actorType `system`/purpose `projection_rebuild`; optimistic concurrency
(`version` = latest seq, `If-Match`) + per-command idempotency (client `eventId`,
unique index); as-of temporal queries (`?asOf=` on list/net-worth) by ledger replay;
beneficiary designations with share-sum ≤ 100 enforced app-side (422) AND by a DB
constraint trigger; step-up gating on beneficiary changes via `StepUpGuard`;
Cedar PEP (`AssetsAuthz`, owner-only, deny-by-default); audit actions `asset.*` +
domain topic `estate.asset.events.v1` (`asset.ledger.appended`, IDs/enums only);
`withTransaction` sets the `app.actor_id` GUC so `_versions` rows carry attribution
(first service to do so). Also landed: the M2 **cross-request DEK race fix** —
`@estate/crypto` `DekConflictError` + adopt-the-winner in `getOrCreateDek`, with a
partial unique index `ux_deks_user_active` on the financial cluster from day one.

**Explicit deviations (surfaced, not silent):** step-up asserted via
gateway-injected `x-estate-stepup-verified` at the same M2 trust level as
`x-estate-user-id` (real session/step-up verification remains the upgrade for
both); additive DDL vs docs/02 §3 (event-id unique index, `(user_id, occurred_at)`
index, beneficiary live-row unique index, deks unique index — propose folding into
docs/02 v1.1); share-sum trigger enforces ≤ 100 rather than the docs' "sum to 100"
(strict equality is unenforceable during incremental designation; the API reports
`designationComplete`); `assets_view` exempt from business-table conventions (no
`_versions` — its history IS the ledger; verified by custom int-test assertions);
domain topic carries IDs/enums only, so docs/01 §4 Zone B Kafka payload crypto is
not yet exercised (prerequisite for any value-bearing consumer).

**M3 follow-ups:** Plaid isolating service (+ `plaid_items`/`accounts` DDL);
deks unique-index backfill migrations for auth+core clusters (pre-flight dedupe of
any doubled DEKs + 23505→`DekConflictError` translation in identity/profile
repositories); local contact-link projection from core domain events →
`namedBeneficiaries` beneficiary ABAC + contact existence validation; transactional
outbox for post-commit audit/domain emits; `DocumentAttached` event + photos (M4);
as-of replay snapshotting at scale; category is immutable in M3 (recategorize =
retire + recreate).

### Later milestones (rough order, one per bounded context)
M3 second half: Plaid isolate ·
M4 documents (template matrix, generation pipeline, S3 doc vault) ·
M5 Terraform/EKS to a real dev environment ·
M6 vault (Zone A) ·
M7 settlement (Temporal) ·
M8 AI assistant (privacy proxy) · then referral, notifications hardening, search.
Vault and settlement come late deliberately: highest-risk domains land on mature
primitives.
